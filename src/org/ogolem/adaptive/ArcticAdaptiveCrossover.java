/**
 * An n-point, generic genotype, real-number-based _intermediate_ crossover operator. A multiple
 * mixing portugal variant, i.e. not a _discrete_, but _intermediate_ recombination (known as
 * frequently used variant in evolution strategies). Aimed purpose: after several runs (farming) and
 * adaption of parameter boundaries, this can be used to map down to best mixed solution. Of course,
 * when using giant boundaries and no seeding, usually a mean value of father and mother is not
 * supposed to be a good solution. Frequently used as "hill climbing" crossover step that is able to
 * sample new values instead of new combinations of values.
 * <p>
 * See: T.Weise's book "Global Optimization Algorithms -- Theory and Application", 3rd ed., pp. 337,
 * "(Weighted) Average Crossover, especially item 2. a random weight more at the center between two
 * alleles.
